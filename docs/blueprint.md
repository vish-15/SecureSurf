## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Navy blue (#00308F) evokes trust and security. It is dark enough to work well in a light color scheme, while still vibrant enough to be noticeable. 
- Background color: Very light blue (#E8F5FF) provides a clean and calming backdrop. Being only 16% saturated, it keeps the focus on more important content. 
- Accent color: Red (#FF0000) is used for warnings and destructive actions to grab user attention, since it has maximum possible saturation.
- Use 'Inter' font for clear readability across all elements.
- Implement a modern, intuitive layout with a focus on clear communication of security information. Organize the content in clear, defined sections.
- Use visual indicators with intuitive icons and color-coding to represent security levels and threat types.
- Subtle animations on data fetching and results presentation.
